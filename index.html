        <h2 class="Question">Q.1	Differentce between "==", and "===" operator</h2>
        

        <p class="Explain">In JavaScript, the "==" operator is used to compare the values of two operands, whereas the "===" operator is used to compare both the values and the data types of the operands.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:
<pre class="Explain">let a =5
    let b= "5"
    console.log(a == b) // true
    console.log(a===b) // false
    </pre>
    </p>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="Question">Q.2	What is Spread operator?</h2>
        
        <p class="Explain">The spread operator is a feature in JavaScript that allows an iterable (such as an array or a string) to be expanded into individual elements. The spread operator is denoted by three dots (...) and can be used in several ways in JavaScript.
    </p>

<div class="container">
        <h2 class="Question">Q.3	What is Difference between 'var', 'let', and 'const'?</h2>
        <p class="Explain">In JavaScript, 'var', 'let', and 'const' are keywords used to declare variables. While they might seem similar, they have some important differences:
1. 'var' declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while 'let' and 'const' are block scoped.
2. 'var' variables can be redeclared and updated while 'let' and 'const' variables cannot be redeclared (in the same scope) and 'const' variables cannot be updated.
        </p>
        
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="Question">Q.4	What is execution context?</h2>
            
            <p class="Explain">When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code. During the context runtime, the parser parses the source code and allocates memory for the variables and functions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="Question">Q.5	 What is meant by first class functions?

        </h2>
            
            <p class="Explain">First-class functions are JavaScript functions that can behave like variables. They can also be parsed as arguments to higher-order functions</p>
            <pre class="Explain">const Person = {
                play:(name) => {
                    return `Hey ${name} is playing`;
                },
                dance:(name) => {
                    return `${name} can dance`
                },
                walk:(name) => {
                    return `I am sure ${name} can walk `
                },
            }
             
            console.log(Person.play("Chibueze"));
            console.log(Person.dance("Chibueze"));
            console.log(Person.walk("Chibueze"));</pre>
        </div>
